The point of a table is that it is rigid.

This is the smallest container inside a table, which is created by a  element ('td' stands for 'table data'). <li> <p>These tables should use a combination of ,  and  tags. Table headers  are useful to easily find the data you are looking for when the headers clearly stand out. Tables headers also have an added benefit \u2014 along with the scope attribute (which we'll learn about in the next article), they allow you to make tables more accessible by associating each header with all the data in the same row or column. Screenreaders are then able to read out a whole row or column of data at once, which is pretty useful. <li> <p>Pagination allows our table to take on a lot of data and arrange it into different pages preventing long tables and perfomance issues that arise with visualising alot of data on one table page. </p> </li>"},{"location":"Libraries/tables/#angular-tables","title":"Angular Tables","text":""},{"location":"Libraries/tables/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<ul> <li>Copy the mytables package into your project's shared folder. </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Install Bootstrap into your project</li> </ul> <p>The tables use bootrstrap for basic styling.

If total characters exceed 300, the text field becomes a text area. Has special validation for character only input <code>integer</code> For digit input. Has special validation for digit only input <code>date</code> Shows Flutter's DatePicker for date input. Works with the <code>start_value</code> &amp; <code>end_value</code> to determine start and end dates respectively <code>multifield</code> Displays multiple Flutter ChoiceChips input field <code>boolean</code> Displays a checkbox input field <code>choice</code> or <code>field</code> Displays a drop down input field <code>email</code> For email input. Has special validation for email only input <p></p> <p></p> <p>Note: </p> <p>It is important to note that much as this field is not required, it comes in handy almost 99% of the time when defining the nitty gritties of your form's input fields.

It's best to use one color predominantly and use the second color as accents in your design Split Complementary A split complementary scheme includes one dominant color and the two colors directly adjacent to the dominant color's complement. This creates a more nuanced color palette than a complementary color scheme while still retaining the benefits of contrasting colors. Triadic Triadic color schemes offer high contrasting color schemes while retaining the same tone.

Tradition has always been to code first then write test cases for the code we've already written. This type of testing has a common point of failure in that, sure the system would would pass the tests because the tests made sure of that, but working on the tests would gradally become more and more difficult. How so? Imagine we have some already existing code and now we're writing tests for it. We are bound to encounter the following problems to name just a few:</p> <ol> <li>Untestable Code : Since the code wasn't designed/written to be testable, there's stuff we can't access in the code for testing. Hence asserting that the code did what we think it should would be difficult.</li> <li>Tests are highly coupled with the code : We end up writing tests that are very specific to the code we've already written. This would mean that chaninging the code would mean having to rewrite the tests for the code as well.</li> <li>Testing the code rather than requirements : We end up testing that the code that we wrote is the code that we wrote, which isn't very helpful. Attention shifts from, 'Does the code do what it's supposed to do?' and goes to 'Does the code work regardless?'</li> </ol> <p>A better approach to testing is writing unit tests even before we code.

The developer can discover these specifications by asking about use cases and user stories. A key benefit of test-driven development is that it makes the developer focus on requirements before writing code. This is in contrast with the usual practice, where unit tests are only written after code.</li> <li>Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons : This shows that new code is actually needed for the desired feature. It validates that the test harness is working correctly. It rules out the possibility that the new test is flawed and will always pass.</li> <li>Write the simplest code that passes the new test : Inelegant or hard code is acceptable, as long as it passes the test. The code will be honed anyway in Step 5. No code should be added beyond the tested functionality.</li> <li>All tests should now pass : If any fail, the new code must be revised until they pass. This ensures the new code meets the test requirements and does not break existing features.</li> <li>Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved : Code is refactored for readability and maintainability. In particular, hard-coded test data should be removed. Running the test suite after each refactor helps ensure that no existing functionality is broken. Examples of refactoring:<ul> <li>Moving code to where it most logically belongs</li> <li>Removing duplicate code</li> <li>Making names self-documenting</li> <li>Splitting methods into smaller pieces</li> <li>Re-arranging inheritance hierarchies</li> </ul> </li> <li>Repeat : The cycle above is repeated for each new piece of functionality. Tests should be small and incremental, and commits made often. That way, if new code fails some tests, the programmer can simply undo or revert rather than debug excessively.</li> </ol> <p>This workflow is sometimes called Red-Green-Refactoring, which comes from the status of the tests within the cycle.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>The red phase indicates that code does not work.</li> <li>The green phase indicates that everything is working, but not necessary in the most optimal way.</li> <li>The blue phase indicates that the tester is refactoring the code, but is confident their code is covered with tests which gives the tester confidence to change and improve our code.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Notes/Mel/tdd/#the-benefits","title":"The Benefits","text":"<ol> <li>Early bug notification</li> <li>Better Designed, cleaner and more extensible code.</li> <li>Confidence to Refactor</li> <li>Good for teamwork</li> <li>Good for Developers</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Notes/Mel/tdd/#example-coding-a-stack-5","title":"EXAMPLE : Coding a Stack 5","text":"<p>Coding Challenge : Implement a stack data structure without using a JS array that implements the LIFO principle.</p> <p>Solution : Using test driven developement to solve this challenge we would first write the test cases based on the requirements of the challenge then go ahead to develop the stack data structure. </p> <p>Step One</p> <p>The requirements to create a stack are that : 1.

They are different than positions as a single person can take on multiple Agile roles depending on the scope of the project. Conversely, multiple people can share the same role. Here are some of the roles you could see in an Agile project: \u200b -Product Owner - The Product Owner, also known as the \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d, defines the product vision based on all insights, feedback, and ideas gathered. He or she is the owner of the product requirements and works closely with the development team to communicate the vision by documenting it in short narratives called User Stories. User Stories typically include a name, description, reference to any external documents, and an explanation of how to test the implementation. Product Owners often maintain a backlog of User Stories if there are too many to be executed concurrently. -Scrum Master - Similar to a project manager, this role is all about making sure the team is following Agile principles, values, and processes. -Team Member - All members of the development team have different skills and collaborate together to build functional software. Teams can include QA engineers, business analysts, designers, database engineers, and more depending on the project scope.</p> <p>Advantages of Agile Methodology</p> <ul> <li>Deliver software well-tailored to an ever-growing understanding of customer demands</li> <li>Software is deployed more quickly and improved more regularly Better code hygiene including style, readability, and structuring Flexible and adaptable process enables pivots or changes mid-project Doesn\u2019t require a complete list of requirements upfront Makes room to act on organizational learning as the project progresses Transparency and continuous communication with involved stakeholders \u200b  \u200b</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Notes/Ricox/sdlc/#agile-frameworks","title":"Agile Frameworks","text":"<p>\u200b</p>"},{"location":"Notes/Ricox/sdlc/#scrum","title":"Scrum","text":"<p>Scrum is a very popular Agile framework characterized by continuous collaboration, frequent deliveries, and special development cycles called \u2018Sprints\u2019.

Commitment meetings, in which the team reviews the backlog of user stories to determine how much effort it involves and how much work can be done during the upcoming Sprint. Daily standup meetings, which are notably short meetings that ensure everyone is aligned. In this regard, each team member communicates updates on story status, blockers, or concerns. Demo meetings, which the team attends at the end of each Sprint to show the functionalities implemented during the current sprint to the Product Owner. Retrospective meetings, which are also hosted at the end of each Sprint to discuss lessons learned, what went well, and what needs improvement.

For example:</p> <p>If \u201cknife\u201d is a product, you are testing; just do not concentrate on checking whether it cuts the vegetables/fruits properly. There are other aspects to look for such as \u2013 the user should be able to handle it comfortably</p> <p>Risk Coverage- listing the risks involved in the application and making sure they\u2019re covered by tests. For Example:</p> <p>While testing an airplane, if a tester tells you that he/she has fully tested the internal system of the airplane and it\u2019s working fine but only flying capability of the airplane was not covered while testing \u2013 what would be your reaction?</p> <p>Well, that is what risk coverage means. Identifying risk as per the application/product and testing it thoroughly is always a good practice.</p> <p>Requirements Coverage- checks if the user's requirements are met.For Example:</p> <p>While testing a chat application, tester took care of all the important points like multiple users chatting in a group, two users chatting independently, all types of emoticons available, updates sent to user immediately etc. but forgot to look into requirement document, which clearly mentioned that when two users chat independently, video call option should be enabled.The client marketed the chat application claiming that it would allow calling, while two users chat independently. You can imagine what would have happened to the chat application.</p> <p>Boundary Value Coverage- Suppose you have a feature that can take numbers as input, but it should only accept numbers from 0 to  100, inclusive. In scenarios like these, to ensure the boundaries are properly tested, you\u2019d typically test at the boundary, and immediately below and above the boundary.</p> <p>Compatibility Coverage- make sure your tests cover your application across different browsers and operating systems</p> <p>AI-Aided Test Automation- consists of the use of test automation tools that rely on AI to take your testing approach to a whole new level</p>"},{"location":"Notes/Wesh/Test%20Coverage/#performing-test-coverage","title":"Performing test coverage","text":"<ol> <li>Test coverage can be done by exercising the static review techniques like peer reviews, inspections, and walkthrough</li> <li>By transforming the ad-hoc defects into executable test cases</li> <li>At code level or unit test level, test coverage can be achieved by availing the automated code coverage or unit test coverage tools</li> <li>Functional test coverage can be done with the help of proper test management tools</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Notes/Wesh/Test%20Coverage/#advantages","title":"Advantages","text":"<ul> <li>It can assure the quality of the test</li> <li>It can help identify what portions of the code were actually touched for the release or fix</li> <li>It can help to determine the paths in your application that were not tested</li> <li>Prevent Defect leakage</li> <li>Time, scope and cost can be kept under control</li> <li>Defect prevention at an early stage of the project lifecycle</li> <li>It can determine all the decision points and paths used in the application, which allows you to increase test coverage</li> <li>Gaps in requirements, test cases and defects at the unit level and code level can be found in an easy way</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Notes/Wesh/Test%20Coverage/#disadvantages","title":"Disadvantages","text":"<ul> <li>Most of the tasks in the test coverage manual as there are no tools to automate.

With Web 3.0, because information would be found based on its content, it could be stored in multiple locations simultaneously and hence be decentralized. With Web 3.0, the data generated by disparate and increasingly powerful computing resources, including mobile phones, desktops, appliances, vehicles, and sensors, will be sold by users through decentralized data networks, ensuring that users retain ownership control.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ubiquity- This is having the capacity to be everywhere at the same time. Web 3.0 simply takes this a step further by making the internet accessible to everyone anywhere, at any time. At some point, internet-connected devices will no longer be concentrated on computers and smartphones like in Web 2.0 since IoT (Internet of Things) technology will bring forth a plethora of  new types of smart devices.</p> </li> <li> <p>Semantic web- the Semantic Web, according to Berners-Lee, enables computers to analyze loads of data from the Web, which includes content, transactions and links between persons. Applying semantics in the Web would enable machines to decode meaning and emotions by analyzing data. Consequently, internet users will have a better experience driven by enhanced data connectivity.</p> </li> <li> <p>Artificial Intelligence- In Web 3.0, computers will be able to understand information similarly to humans, through technologies based upon Semantic Web concepts and natural language processing. Web 3.0 will also use machine learning, which is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses data and algorithms to imitate how humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. These capabilities will enable computers to produce faster and more relevant results in a host of areas like drug development and new materials, as opposed to merely targeted advertising that forms the bulk of current efforts.</p> </li> <li> <p>3D graphics- Some futurists also call Web 3.0 the Spatial Web as it aims to blur the line between the physical and the digital by revolutionizing graphics technology, bringing into clear focus three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Notes/Wesh/Web%203.0/#web-30-applications","title":"Web 3.0 Applications","text":"<p>Web 3.0 application is the ability to digest large-scale information and turn it into factual knowledge and useful executions for users.

This can help tailor the app's features and insights to the individual user's financial habits and needs. To effectively implement this, we may consider the following factors:-</p> <p>Privacy and Data Security: - Ensure that we maintain strong data privacy and security measures, as we will be collecting sensitive information about users' financial behaviors. Users need to trust that their data will be handled with the utmost care.</p> <p>Informed Consent: - Clearly communicate to users what data we will collect, how we will use it, and how it will benefit them. Obtain informed consent before collecting any psychological assessment data.</p> <p>Psychological Assessment Questions: - Design the questions with input from psychologists or behavioral economists. These questions should aim to understand users' attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding money. For example:</p> <ul> <li>What are your financial goals and priorities?</li> <li>On a scale of 1-10, How do you feel about saving money for the future?</li> <li>On a scale of 1-10, How comfortable are you with risk in investments?</li> <li>Do you have any financial anxieties or concerns?</li> <li>On a scale of 1-10, How do you handle impulse purchases?</li> <li>On a scale of 1-10, Are you more of a spender or a saver?</li> <li>On a scale of least - most often, How often do you feel stressed about your financial situation?</li> <li>Do you currently have any outstanding debts, such as loans or credit card balances?</li> <li>How comfortable are you with managing and reducing your debt?</li> <li>Are you consistent in tracking your expenses and income?</li> <li>How familiar are you with various investment options, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate?</li> <li>Do you have a financial support system, such as family or friends, for advice or assistance in managing your finances?</li> </ul> <p>User-Friendly Interface: - We could make the assessment process user-friendly, possibly in the form of a gamified close-ended questionnaire.</p> <p>Customized User Profiles: - Based on the assessment, we coudl create user profiles or personas. For example, someone might be a \"saver\" who is risk-averse, while another might be a \"spender\" with a more relaxed attitude toward saving.</p> <p>Behavioral Insights: - While Leveraging AI to provide behavioral insights based on the assessment results. For example, offer tips and suggestions for improving financial habits, setting and achieving goals, or reducing financial stress.</p> <p>Peer Comparisons: - Allow users to compare their financial habits with peers in similar demographics. This can provide valuable context and motivation for improvement.</p> <p>Financial Literacy Resources: - Offer access to educational content or links to resources that can help users better understand and manage their finances.</p> <p>Continuous Assessment: - Allow users to update their financial profile periodically, as people's financial situations and attitudes can change over time.</p> <p>Feedback Mechanism: - Provide users with feedback and reports that help them track their progress and make informed financial decisions. Regularly check in with users and ask for feedback on the app's effectiveness.</p> <p>User Engagement: - Use gamification and notifications to keep users engaged and motivated to improve their financial well-being.</p> <p>User-Centric Approach: - Keep the user's well-being and financial health at the center of your app's design and features.
