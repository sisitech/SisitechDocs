# **MARKDOWN.**
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text using plain text editors. It is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums, collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files[2]. Markdown is easy to learn and use, and it can be used to format virtually any document[1]. The syntax of Markdown is comprised entirely of punctuation characters, which have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean[3]. 

## **Here are some basic elements of Markdown**:

**Headers**: Use # to create headings. The number of # determines the level of the heading. For example, # Header 1, ## Header 2, ### Header 3, and so on.

**Emphasis**: Use * or _ to create italic text, and ** or __ to create bold text. For example, *italic*, _italic_, **bold**, and __bold__.

**Lists**: Use * or - to create unordered lists, and 1. (or 1) to create ordered lists. For example, * Item 1, * Item 2, and 1. Item 1, 2. Item 2.

**Links**: Use [text](url) to create a hyperlink. For example, [Google](https://www.google.com).

**Images**: Use alt text](image url) to insert an image. For example, ![cat].

**Code**: Use `code` to format inline code, and ```code``` to format code blocks. For example, `print("Hello, world!")` and ```python print("Hello, world!") ```.

## **Basic syntax rules for Markdown**
The basic syntax rules for Markdown are as follows:

- To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don't have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number 1.
- To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.
- To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.
- To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (*), dashes (-), or underscores (_).

## **Common Markdown syntax errors and how to fix them**
Here are some common Markdown syntax errors and how to fix them:

**Missing empty lines surrounding blocks**: Markdown requires empty lines before and after block elements such as headers, lists, and code blocks. If you don't add these empty lines, your Markdown may not render correctly. To fix this, add empty lines before and after block elements.

**Incorrect headers**: Headers in Markdown require a space after the # symbol. If you don't add this space, your header won't render correctly. To fix this, add a space after the # symbol.

 **Inconsistent indentation**: Markdown uses whitespace as syntax, so inconsistent indentation can throw off your formatting. To fix this, make sure you use consistent indentation throughout your Markdown document.

 **Missing or incorrect links**: Links in Markdown require both a link text and a URL. If you don't include both of these, your link won't render correctly. To fix this, make sure you include both the link text and the URL in your link syntax.

 **Missing or incorrect emphasis**: Emphasis in Markdown requires matching pairs of asterisks or underscores. If you don't use matching pairs, your emphasis won't render correctly. To fix this, make sure you use matching pairs of asterisks or underscores for emphasis.

## **Markdown tables**
Markdown tables are a useful way to organize data in a structured format. Here are some tips to avoid common Markdown syntax errors related to tables:

 **Missing or incorrect table formatting**: Tables in Markdown require a specific format, with vertical bars (|) separating each column and hyphens (-) separating the header row from the rest of the table. If you don't use this format, your table won't render correctly. To fix this, make sure you use the correct table formatting.
**Incorrect alignment**: Tables in Markdown can be aligned to the left, right, or center using colons (:). If you don't use colons to align your table, your table won't render correctly. To fix this, make sure you use colons to align your table.
**Missing or incorrect table headers**: Tables in Markdown require a header row to define the column names. If you don't include a header row, your table won't render correctly. To fix this, make sure you include a header row in your table.
**Incorrect use of backticks**: Backticks (`) are used to format code in Markdown, but they can interfere with table formatting if used incorrectly. If you use backticks in your table, your table won't render correctly. To fix this, make sure you don't use backticks in your table.

To create a table in Markdown, use vertical bars (|) to separate each column, and use hyphens (-) to create each column's header. You can also use colons (:), to align the text in each column. For more information on how to create tables in Markdown.

### **How to add images to a Markdown table**
you can use the following syntax to add images to a table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| ![](image1.png) | ![](image2.png) |


This will create a table with two columns and two rows, with each cell containing an image. Note that the images should be in the same directory as the Markdown file, or in a subdirectory that is relative to the Markdown file. Another way to add images to a table is to use HTML's image tag. For example, you can use the following syntax to add images to a table using HTML:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| <img src="image1.png" width="100"> | <img src="image2.png" width="100"> |

This will create a table with two columns and two rows, with each cell containing an image. Note that you can use the width attribute to specify the width of the images
How can I resize an image in a Markdown table

To resize an image in a Markdown table, you can use HTML's img tag and set the width and height attributes. Here's an example:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| <img src="image1.png" width="100" height="100"> | <img src="image2.png" width="100" height="100"> |

This will create a table with two columns and two rows, with each cell containing an image that is 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. You can adjust the width and height attributes to resize the images as needed.Another way to resize images in Markdown is to use CSS. You can add a style attribute to the img tag and set the width and height properties using CSS. Here's an example:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| <img src="image1.png" style="width:100px;height:100px;"> | <img src="image2.png" style="width:100px;height:100px;"> |

This will create a table with two columns and two rows, with each cell containing an image that is 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. You can adjust the width and height properties to resize the images as needed
